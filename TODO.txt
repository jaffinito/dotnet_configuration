TODO:
- Need to work on element based textboxes so that they look like other attribute based ones.
- Need to make add/remove buttons add items infront of themselves
- Need to make track count of add.remove items so taht we dont go over max count/ also remove
- Fix errorCollector.attributes.include and .exclude
	This now give buttons, but two sets at the end. Changed from Dict to List to make this happen

POSSIBLE FIXES:
- Could use multiline textboxes to handle include/exclude and even other fields.
	Would require custom detection.  include/exclude already has this in a way with the sequence>sequence>element stuff. Others possible
	Would allow for counts easily.
	Detection would be needed during config read and save as well. could be custom class for all functions.
	PROBLEM: this will NOT work for applicationPools since that has elements with TWO attributes.
		Could use comma to indicate the value.
